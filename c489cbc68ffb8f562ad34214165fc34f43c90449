      "message": "Done.\n\nYeah, it\u0027s amazing how sometimes you can ponder for many minutes over one line of simple code. I actually had an else at first, but my first try had a more complicated second block, so it seemed too convoluted, so then I was going to pull the first two arms out into a helper function but that seemed a bit heavy, but then I realized it didn\u0027t need to be so complicated, etc.\n\nAnyyyway, I think you\u0027re right that moving from_env into a nested else is probably clearer.\n\n...\n\nThough now that I write that, maybe some nested functions are actually better, and it reduces the stuttering of (install_dir, script_path). Or maybe that\u0027s a bit too cute I shouldn\u0027t fiddle late at night. We\u0027ll see in the morning. :)",
