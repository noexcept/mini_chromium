      "message": "Oh shoot, things are half-landed sorry. I believe this should stay as current_cpu.\n\nI find the two names especially confusing, but my understanding is that target_cpu is used sparingly and it means the target for the whole build.\n\nBut if you\u0027re currently building a target that\u0027s building with a non-default toolchain (e.g. for a host tool) then you\u0027d want it to be current_cpu, which will be the one that\u0027s being built for in a particular target.\n\nThe reason your gn gen failed, is that the setting of current_cpu is supposed to be accomplished by BUILDCONFIG.gn, but I haven\u0027t landed that yet (or even sent it for review): https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/crashpad/crashpad/+/786312/4/build/BUILDCONFIG.gn.",
