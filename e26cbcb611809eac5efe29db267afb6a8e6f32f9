I did this a little differently in the GN build for…well, I had a good reason at the time, but I guess I didn’t capture it in a comment. I may have just been trying to avoid having crashpad_handler.com appear in the filesystem at its final path in a not-quite-completely-editbinned state.\n\nNo action required, I just thought you might be interested to see how I cooked it, in case you had other ideas.",
