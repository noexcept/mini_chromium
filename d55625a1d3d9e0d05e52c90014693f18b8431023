      "message": "solink_module is for loadable modules as opposed to shared libraries intended to be linked against directly, right? If so, don’t want this to vary between Mac and non-Mac. Nobody should get a “lib” prefix by default to match the GYP build and particularly the test code’s expectations. The “lib” prefix is only for shared libraries intended to be linked against (which I think is tool(\"solink\"), no module?)\n\nIf Chromium’s GN build behaves differently and we’ve got to maintain compatibility with that, then we’ll have to figure out some way to deal. Setting output_prefix \u003d \"\" explicitly in our own targets, perhaps?",
