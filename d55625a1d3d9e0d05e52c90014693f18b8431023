      "message": "solink_module is for loadable modules as opposed to shared libraries intended to be linked against directly, right? If so, don’t want this to vary between Mac and non-Mac. Nobody should get a “lib” prefix by default to match the GYP build and particularly the test code’s expectations. The “lib” prefix is only for shared libraries intended to be linked against (which I think is tool(\"solink\"), no module?)\n\nIf Chromium’s GN build behaves differently and we’ve got to maintain compatibility with that, then we’ll have to figure out some way to deal. Setting output_prefix \u003d \"\" explicitly in our own targets, perhaps?",

It seems like https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/crashpad/crashpad/snapshot/crashpad_info_client_options_test.cc?rcl\u003dc40a6ce516cb542ed97bb7a8c81bd0626bc9ed7e\u0026l\u003d145 should return crashpad_snapshot_test_module.so. And it does, and indeed the built file matches that name.\n\n...\n\nHuh, output_prefix is set in solink_module for Chromium, but it doesn\u0027t actually do anything. But it does here in mini_chromium. I have no idea why.\n\n...\n\nI found output_prefix_override and thought maybe that was the cause (a magic GN variable that tells it not to use output_prefix on a per target basis), but I don\u0027t see that being set.\n\nHrm.",
