      "message": "\u003e I thought fuchsia wasn\u0027t considered POSIX anymore?\n\nThis is supposed to be no-change, and Fuchsia was definitely considered POSIX at #b32. It’s not considered POSIX in the Chrome build anymore since 65421f69a6e0, but it is in mini_chromium, and Fuchsia’s own Crashpad build picks up mini_chromium and uses that definition.\n\nI’m reluctant to change anything here because I think it’ll break Fuchsia’s own build. Ideally, mini_chromium and Chromium would agree on whether Fuchsia is POSIX, but I think that this is a question (and possibly task) for someone more familiar with the Crashpad integration on Fuchsia.",
