Was this for the _Unwind_* symbols, or something else?\n\nThis library should really be left to the compiler driver, it’d be nice to figure out why it’s needed but not being specified given the c and ld flags we’re using. Might be a buglet in the compiler driver, y’know?",

Do you happen to know what the correct invocation is to link against libstdc++ is? (This is required because Chromium has really old minspec, and no libc++ in the sysroot.)",
