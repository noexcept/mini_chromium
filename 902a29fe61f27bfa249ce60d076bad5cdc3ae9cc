Are they supposed to be the same flags you would get when building with chromium?",

      "message": "Shoot, no, this was dumb. I was just thinking I just wanted to make this flag *more* global (which this does for Crashpad), but wasn\u0027t thinking about the Chromium build (which uses the other BUILD.gn files, but not this global one, which is in-Crashpad-only).\n\nDo you want me to revert/re-add the disables in the other files? Or are you already shepherding it through? (You could probably just add the few missing /wds in the chromium tree CL to get the roll through and then \"upstream\" afterwards).",
