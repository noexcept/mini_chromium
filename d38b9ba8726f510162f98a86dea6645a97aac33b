      "message": "\u003e Isn’t there supposed to be a filter that deals with this?\n\nPersonally I\u0027m very much in favor of breaking this out; Fuchsia doesn\u0027t have the magic \"mac/win/linux\" filter in place, so we\u0027d need to install a special one just for this repo. But if this repo decides to stick with the filter magic, we\u0027ll find a way to make it happen on our side.\n\nIt\u0027s also complicated for us because in some cases we\u0027re enough like linux to use a linux file, or enough like windows to use a win file, so the win/mac/linux trichotomy gets blurred and the behavior of the magic filter becomes harder to reason about.",

      "message": "Brett\u0027s stated GN policy in Chromium is that we shouldn\u0027t add more source filters, e.g. for _fuchsia files. During the gyp transition, it was too confusing to *not* have _win/_mac magic filters, so those exist via a sort of weird GN feature. But he didn\u0027t want to add more for new platforms. So there\u0027s sort an asymmetry in how they\u0027re normally listed.\n\nmini_chromium/build/BUILDCONFIG.gn is where set_sources_assignment_filter defined for Crashpad. (But they are there now, which is why I missed the .mm file.)\n\nProbably the best thing to do is just remove that then as we\u0027re not currently relying on it, and switch to explicit conditionals for our GN files. That way we match the Fuchsia-in-Chromium code, and we wouldn\u0027t create additional complexity for consuming these GN files in a future Crashpad-in-Fuchsia build.",
