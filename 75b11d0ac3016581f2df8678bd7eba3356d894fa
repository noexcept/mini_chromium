It’s the same thing, so unless a VLA shows up in Android-only code that’s built by the standalone Android GYP build, this should be fine. No buildbot for that, so if a developer build stops working, we can just fix it when it breaks.\n\nChromium doesn’t use -Wvla (yet?) so it wouldn’t have caught VLAs in Android code either.",
